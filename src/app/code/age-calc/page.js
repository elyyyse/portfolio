        An app that calculates how old you are to the day. Built using native
        JavaScript dates objects. I did this in part because I didn&apos;t know

        underlying pain points of a technology before getting comfortable with a
        tool that papers over it. This app was designed by Frontend Mentor.

        This calculator is deceptive in its simplicity. Subtract birth year from
        this year. Subtract birth month from this month. Subtract birth date
        from today&apos;s date. And you&apos;re done, right? But that only works
        if the user has already celebrated a birthday this year AND that
        birthday happened before the current month started AND their date of
        birth is a smaller number than today&apos;s date. And don&apos;t even
        get me started on leap years.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.pContinued}>
        Once the basic logic was up and running, there were several fiddly
        little details to work through. Like custom error states
        <Footnote>
          I used aria-errormessage and aria-invalid to keep these custom
          messages accessible.
        </Footnote>{' '}
        if any single input was invalid, but also if their combined value
        created an invalid date (like April 31st or a date in the future). Or
        making sure the words &lsquo;years, months, days&rsquo; update to the
        singular form if their respective output number is 1.

        I&apos;m someone who values organization and legibility, and that
        absolutely extends to my code. This project was a bit of a trial in that
        regard and gave me a real appreciation for refactoring. I found myself
        going back over my code again and again to name or rename variables, to
        collect repetitive logic into reusable functions, and to leave clear
        comments when I felt my naming wasn&apos;t quite enough info.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.pContinued}>
        When I built this app, I was flummoxed by the concept of epoch time and
        UTC and just kind of ignored it in favor of date formats that made more
        sense to me. In hindsight, I think I could have simplified things had a
        taken advantage of UTC. It&apos;s something I might attempt in the
        future.

        My biggest challenge by far was figuring out the leap year math. The
        issues kept popping up like a game of whack-a-mole. It wasn&apos;t too
        difficult to get things working for 2023, but it was obvious that come
        March 2024, my calculations were going to be off by a day. When I
        finally took to pen and paper to sketch out the problem, I was able to
        find solutions that, as of this writing, I haven&apos;t been able break.
